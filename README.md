# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game that you can play in your browser. The game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface and handle the game logic. The user chooses their move by clicking on the corresponding button, and the computer's move is randomly generated. The game then determines the winner based on the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules and displays the result to the user. The game keeps track of the score and allows the user to reset the game after the winner is declared.
